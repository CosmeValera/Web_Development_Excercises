# Web development exercises- Juan Valera Reales

## Description

This repository contains two exercises created by Juan Valera Reales for practicing web development
skills. The project consists of two main parts: a frontend application built with React and Vite, and a backend
API developed with Node.js and Docker.

### Frontend

The frontend, is a React application located in the frontend/ directory. It fetches and displays fictional users in a
grid layout, loading more users as the user scrolls down. The application leverages Material-UI for styling and provides
a seamless infinite scrolling experience.

### Backend

The backend, found in the backend/ directory, is a Node.js application that exposes two endpoints related to Pokémon
data using the PokeAPI. This application is containerized with Docker for easy deployment and execution. The endpoints
allow users to search for Pokémon by name and retrieve a CSV file listing Pokémon by color.
